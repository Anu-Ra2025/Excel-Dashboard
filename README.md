## Data Overview
This project analyze and visualizes with course students prefer lot along with attendance and retention rate. Gender wise course preference and monthly basis engagement rate including in the dashboard:
•	student ID (Unique identifier for each student)
•	Name (Anonymized or actual student names)
•	Age (Demographic categorization)
•	Gender (Diversity and inclusion analysis)
•	Course Name (Academic program classification)
•	Enrollment Date (Timeline of student registration)
•	Attendance (Tracking participation and engagement)
The primary goal is to derive data-driven insights by calculating key metrics, including:
•	Retention Rate – Evaluating student persistence over time
•	Average Attendance Trends – Identifying patterns in participation
•	Enrollment Growth & Distribution – Analyzing trends across different courses
•	Course Satisfaction Rate – Gauging student feedback and engagement
Through advanced data analysis and visualization techniques, this project aims to deliver actionable insights that support informed decision-making, ultimately enhancing student engagement and academic success.

## Data Cleaning:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71311c9b-f5dc-45dc-9870-d5ee065bbe93)
•	Implemented advanced data cleaning processes to identify and remove duplicate entries, standardizing the data (e.g., converting 1050 to 10K).
•	Replaced the Enrollment Date column with a standardized date format and cleaned the data accordingly.![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5ca2ca6-cf6b-4bff-8972-f369cc250aa0)![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1dca593-e905-4176-85c1-1e3f4796670a)

•	Applied robust data preprocessing techniques, imputing missing values using appropriate statistical methods and eliminating incomplete records (e.g., Age, Gender, Attendance Percentage, Retention Status, and Satisfaction Score) to ensure data integrity.![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b24019b-790a-4e4d-b383-96a545c7fd7d)

•	Conducted thorough data validation by standardizing date formats for enrollment records and applying logical constraints to attendance values to ensure accuracy and consistency.Optimized data structure by standardizing column names, change uniform formatting conventions, and enhancing schema consistency for seamless data integration and analysis.
